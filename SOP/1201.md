# Handoff: Mobile Overlay Sluggishness – Root Cause & Fix

## 1 · Summary
On iOS Safari the dark page overlay seems to *fade out* after the native `<select>` picker is dismissed.  
The overlay **is not actually animating** – its `transition` is `none` as intended – but it stays visible
until the ***blur*** event on the `<select>` fires.  
iOS defers `blur` until its own dismissal animation finishes (~300 ms), so the UI *feels* sluggish.

## 2 · Root‑Cause Evidence
1.  Insert a timestamped `console.log('[blur]', performance.now())` at the top of the existing  
    `toneSelect.addEventListener('blur', …)` handler in `public/script.js`.  
2.  Open the Tone picker on an iPhone, then tap outside to cancel.  
3.  In the remote inspector you will see the log ~300 ms **after** the picker vanishes – exactly the delay
    users perceive.  
4.  When `document.body.classList.remove('overlay‑active')` finally runs the overlay disappears instantly,
    proving CSS is not at fault. fileciteturn1file1

## 3 · Fix Strategy (Recommended)
### A. Decouple overlay removal from *blur*
Hide the overlay **immediately** when the picker closes or the user taps elsewhere:

```javascript
// public/script.js  (inside DOMContentLoaded)
const overlay = document.getElementById('page-overlay');
const closeOverlay = () => document.body.classList.remove('overlay-active');

toneSelect.addEventListener('focus', () => {
  document.body.classList.add('overlay-active');

  /* One–shot listeners so we do **not** spam the document */
  const off = () => {
    closeOverlay();
    document.removeEventListener('touchend', off, true);
    document.removeEventListener('mousedown', off, true);
  };

  /* iOS dispatches touchend / mousedown before blur,
     giving us an early moment to hide the overlay.    */
  document.addEventListener('touchend', off, true);
  document.addEventListener('mousedown', off, true);
});

toneSelect.addEventListener('change', closeOverlay); // still needed
toneSelect.addEventListener('blur',   closeOverlay); // fall‑back
```

*Works because* the *touchend / mousedown* events fire as soon as the picker is dismissed, well before
Safari queues the `blur` event.

### B. (Optional) Remove pointer‑events
If you *only* need to dim the background you can keep the overlay in the DOM and toggle **opacity** alone:

```css
#page-overlay { pointer-events:none; }
body.overlay-active #page-overlay { opacity:1; }
```

This avoids any re‑flow triggered by `display: none/block`, shaving another few ms.

## 4 · Implementation Checklist
| File | Action |
| ---- | ------ |
| [`public/script.js`](../public/script.js) | Replace the current focus / blur logic with the snippet above. |
| [`public/style.css`](../public/style.css) | *(Optional)* add `pointer-events:none` as shown. No transition changes required. |
| [`public/index.html`](../public/index.html) | No changes. |

## 5 · Validation
1. Hard‑refresh on device (disable cache).  
2. Open Tone picker → overlay appears.  
3. Tap outside or select an option → overlay *immediately* disappears (<40 ms).  
4. Repeat on Android & Desktop – behaviour unchanged.

## 6 · Roll‑Back Plan
The change is isolated to one JS block; revert by restoring the previous listeners if any regression is observed.
