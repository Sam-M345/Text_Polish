# Handoff: Mobile Overlay Sluggishness

> **IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS (for human or AI generating a new handoff):**
>
> 1.  **Create a brand-new Markdown file directly within the `SOP/` folder.**
> 2.  **Use a clear, descriptive name for the new file** (e.g., `Handoff-LoginBug-MobileLayout.md`).
>     _Do NOT include dates or times in the filename._
> 3.  _Never overwrite or rename existing hand-off documents._
> 4.  **Ensure all file paths listed below are clickable relative markdown links** (e.g., `[filename.ext](../path/to/filename.ext)`).

## 2 · Problem Statement

Describe **what's wrong** and **why it matters**. Include:

- **Symptoms / error messages**: On mobile devices (iOS), when the native dropdown menu is dismissed, the dark `#page-overlay` fades out slowly instead of disappearing instantly. This creates a sluggish user experience.
- **Expected vs. actual behaviour**: The overlay should disappear instantaneously, as its CSS `transition` property has been explicitly set to `none`. The native dropdown UI dismisses quickly, but the overlay does not.
- **Business or user impact (severity & priority)**: Low severity, but a significant UI/UX issue. It makes the application feel unresponsive and unpolished on mobile.

---

## 3 · Reproduction Steps

Step-by-step guide to make the issue appear:

1.  Open the application on a mobile device (specifically iOS or Safari's mobile simulator).
2.  Tap the "Tone" dropdown to open it. The overlay and the native picker UI will appear.
3.  Dismiss the picker by tapping the same tone again or by tapping in the empty space next to it.
4.  Observe that the native picker dismisses instantly, but the black overlay lingers and fades out slowly.

| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| #1      | Reduced the CSS `transition` duration on `#page-overlay` from `0.3s` to `0.05s`. | The user reported the transition still felt sluggish and was not a significant improvement.                                                                         |
| #2      | Set the CSS `transition` property on `#page-overlay` to `none`.                  | This should have removed the animation entirely, but the perceived sluggishness remains. This is the core of the mystery; the visual behavior contradicts the code. |

> **Current blockers / unknowns:**

> - The root cause of the delay is unknown. It is not clear if this is a browser rendering bug, a delayed JavaScript event (`blur`), or a caching issue.

## 5 · Developer Instructions

**Goal:** Identify the source of the fade-out delay and ensure the overlay disappears instantly on mobile.

1.  **Verify Asset Caching:** First, rule out caching. Use the mobile browser's developer tools to perform a hard refresh and disable the cache to ensure the device is using the latest version of `public/style.css` with `transition: none;`.
2.  **Investigate Event Timing:** Add `console.log` statements with timestamps to the beginning of the `blur` event listener for the `toneSelect` element in `public/script.js`. Check the console when dismissing the native picker to see if there is a noticeable delay between the UI dismissing and the JavaScript event firing.
3.  **Performance Profiling:** Use the mobile browser's performance profiler to record the dismissal action. Analyze the timeline for any long-running tasks, style recalculations, or rendering processes on the main thread that could be blocking the immediate removal of the overlay.
4.  **Alternative Implementation:** If profiling suggests a browser-specific quirk with class-based style changes on a `blur` event, try a more direct manipulation as a test. In the `blur` event listener in `public/script.js`, instead of removing the `overlay-active` class, try hiding the element directly: `document.getElementById('page-overlay').style.display = 'none';`. This might bypass the rendering bottleneck.
