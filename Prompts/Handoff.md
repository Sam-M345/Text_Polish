### Problem Statement

We're experiencing an issue where car/automobile emojis (üöó) occasionally appear in text responses when users select "Auto" as the Length or Writing Tone option.

- **Exact symptoms**: Car/vehicle emojis (üöó) appear in responses even though these emojis aren't relevant to the text content
- **Expected behavior**: "Auto" should be interpreted as "automatically determine appropriate length/tone" without any association to automobiles
- **Reproduction steps**:
  1. Enter any text in the input field
  2. Select "Auto" for Length and/or Writing Tone
  3. Click "Improve"
  4. Observe car emojis in the response
- **Context**: The "Auto" option is intended to let the AI automatically determine the most appropriate length or tone based on the input content
- **User impact**: Medium severity - doesn't break functionality but creates confusion and undermines the professional quality of responses

### Affected Files

- [`src/app.js`](file:///src/app.js) - Main Express server file containing API endpoint and OpenAI integration
- [`public/script.js`](file:///public/script.js) - Client-side JavaScript for handling UI interactions
- [`public/index.html`](file:///public/index.html) - HTML structure including the "Auto" option buttons

### Attempted Solutions

1. **Approach #1**: Added explicit instructions in system messages

   - Updated the system message in `app.js` to specify that "auto" refers to automatic selection, not automobiles
   - Added the text "This does NOT refer to automobiles or vehicles" to clarify
   - This reduced but did not eliminate the issue

2. **Approach #2**: Enhanced prompt generation function

   - Updated `generatePrompt` function to include specific explanations for "auto" length and tone
   - Created separate handling for "auto" vs. specific tones
   - Used conditional rendering to customize instructions based on selections
   - Still seeing car emojis in some responses

3. **Approach #3**: Updated emoji handling for "auto" tone

   - Modified `getToneEmoji` to return empty string for "auto" tone
   - Updated `addEmojiToText` to not add emojis when tone is "auto"
   - Updated `generateFallbackResponse` to handle "auto" for both tone and textLength
   - Issue persists despite these changes

4. **Current obstacles**:
   - The language model seems to still associate "auto" with automobiles despite explicit instructions
   - Likely an issue with how the model's training data associates "auto" strongly with cars
   - Edge cases in API responses or fallback scenarios may not be fully covered

### Developer Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: Please review this document thoroughly before proceeding.

Your task:

1. Analyze the codebase focusing on the affected files, particularly how the "auto" parameter is processed
2. The root cause appears to be OpenAI's interpretation of the word "auto" - we need a stronger approach to preventing this association
3. Proposed solution directions:

   - Replace all instances of "auto" with a less ambiguous term like "automatic" or "smart-select" in both UI and API communication
   - Implement pre-processing of responses to detect and remove automobile-related emojis
   - Create a more robust validation layer that checks responses for car emojis before sending to the client
   - Consider implementing a custom post-processing filter specifically targeting known vehicle emojis (üöó, üöô, üèéÔ∏è, etc.)

4. Implementation suggestions:

   - Rename "auto" to "automatic" in the UI and in all variables
   - Add a response filter function that removes automobile emojis from responses
   - Create a more comprehensive test suite to verify emoji handling
   - Enhance the prompt engineering to more explicitly guide the model

5. Potential side effects:
   - Changing the UI terminology might require user education
   - More aggressive emoji filtering might inadvertently remove wanted emojis in some contexts
   - Additional processing could slightly increase response time

Please document your findings and reasoning in detail to help build our collective understanding of this issue.
